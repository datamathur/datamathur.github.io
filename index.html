								<h2 class="major">Work Experiences</h2>
								<p>Here are some details of my experiences at amazing organisations of which I've been a part.</p>

								<h4 class="major">1. Data Scientist at Quinbay</h4>
								<p>I joined Quinbay as a full-time Data Scientist post completing my B.Tech. in May 2022. As part of a Data Science that catered to the e-commerce needs of <a href="https://www.blibli.com/">BliBli.com</a>, I was part of some of the most exciting and comprehensive <b>Deep Learning</b> projects.<br></p>

								<h4 class="major">2. ML Engineering Internship at Hono</h4>
								<p>I joined Hono in <b>July 2021</b> as a ML Engineering Intern. I worked on real-life HR related data and I performed predictive analysis over specific aspect of these datasets.<br>
								<b>Data Preproceesing</b>, <b>ML Algorithms</b>, and <b>Project Documentation</b> were some of the tasks I performed on almost daily basis.</p>

								
								<h4 class="major">3. Data Science Internship at ImagoAI</h4>
								<p>I joined ImagoAI for <b>April - May 2021</b> as a Data Science Intern. My main responsibilty was to making ML models for Hyperspectral data which was both challenging and exciting at the same time.<br> 
								I acquired many valuable skills like <b>data prepocessing</b>, <b>team work</b>, <b>time management</b>, and <b>adaptability</b>. Working for ImagoAI was a life-changing experience.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>

								<h4 class="major">1. Semantic Segmentation of Ocular Images</h4>
								<p>From <b>September 2020 - February 2021</b> I worked under Dr. Mayank Goswami, Assistant Professor, Department of Physics, IIT Roorkee as a research intern.<br>
								The learning opportunities were tremendeous in this <b>Deep Learning project</b>. I acquired some valuable data science skills like <b>data annotation</b> and <b>hyperparameter tuning</b></p>

								<h4 class="major">2. Breast Cancer Classification</h4>
								<p>In <b>January 2021</b>, I started working on my course project for IEE 03 - Artificial Neural Networks with my classmate Aman Arora.<br> 
								The project aims to develop classifier for Classification of Breast Tumor into Malignant (cancer tumor) and Benign (non-cancer tumor) using features obtained from several cell images. The dataset we used for this purpose was Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from Scikit Learn. The classification process was carried out by three models, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (with Particle Swarm Optimizer), and Neural Network (with Gradient Descent). The main objective is to compare these three models and find the most suitable model.<br>

								<h4 class="major">3. Motion of Liquid Droplet on Inclined Hydrophobic Surfaces</h4>
								<p>In <b>June 2019</b>, I worked under Dr. Gaurav Manik, Associate Professor, Department of Polymer and Packaging, IIT Roorkee as a research intern.<br>
								My project specification was very simple which were to help Mr. Sushanta Sethi, Ph.D. student at the Department of Polymer and Packaging, IIT Roorkee, in proceeding with his research in the field of super-hydrophobic polymers. In doing so I had to script an extended library for the Forcite module of Material Studio. The library must help in calculating the contact angle and motion of a liquid droplet on an inclined surface coated with super-hydrophobic polymers. <br>
							    While working there, I learned how to work with a research team and how to tailor software codes according to requirements.<br></p>

								<h4 class="major">4. Production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel</h4>
								<p>As a part of the B.Tech. curriculum, I was teamed with 4 more batchmates to pursue this project for 2 semesters under the mentorship of Dr. PK Jha, Associate Professor, Chemical Department, IIT Roorkee. The aim of the project was to design a production plant that optimizes the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in India.<br>
								After working for more than 8 months as a team, we completed the project and passed the academic requirements with flying colors. We were able to satisy our reviewers in 6 reviews and in our final B.Tech. Project Presentation the panel found our work reasonable and our answers convinving.<br>
							    Above all, I found that this project not only inflated my knowledge in Chemical Engineering but also rekindled my spirit of research and camaraderie.</p>

								<h4 class="major">1. Facial Expression Recognition</h4>
								<p>In <b>September 2020</b>, I collaborated with my friend <a href="https://github.com/mojito-ai" target="_blank">Mohit Sharma</a> to do a comparative study of various Machine Learning and Computer Vision models over the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013" target="_blank">FER2013 dataset</a>.<br>
								Mohit worked on various classical Machine Learning models to build a Facial Expression Recognizer while I worked on various Deep Learning models to build the same. To see our work visit this <a href="https://github.com/007mathur/Facial-Expression-Recognition" target="_blank">repository</a>.</p>

								<h4 class="major">2. Melbourne Housing Prices</h4>
								<p>In <b>August 2020</b>, I worked on a regression dataset, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot" target="_blank">Melbourne Housing Snapshot</a>. This project was very curious because it had 20 features in it which were highly inter-related and I selected the appropiate features without the use of techniques like PCA.<br>
								I selected 9 features to train my models - Rooms, Type, Distance, Car, Bathroom, Landsize, Lattitude, Longtitude, and Propertycount, each of which is clearly explained in my <a href="https://github.com/007mathur/Melbourne-Housing-Prices" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.<br>
								I made 3 model to train on this dataset and the <b>R<sup>2</sup> Score</b> of those models were, <b>0.999999999999997 from Polynomial Regression</b>, <b>0.9999916206262129 from Lasso Regression</b>, and <b>0.9999942091830432 from Decision Tree Regressor</b>.</p>
								
								<h4 class="major">3. CIFAR-10</h4>
								<p>Later in <b>May 2020</b> after practicing my basics over Digit Recognition, I further dove into Computer Vision by trying out an immersive comparative study of various successful CNN models over the famous <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html" target="_blank">CIFAR-10 dataset</a>.<br>
								I used three Deep Learning Models on this CIFAR-10 dataset, <b>Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Residual Neural Networks</b> giving accuracies of <b>48.42%, 72.899%, and 77.759%</b> respectively.<br>
								By this <a href="https://github.com/007mathur/CIFAR-10" target="_blank">comparative study</a> I devised my own proof of concept that by using the concept of residual networks or skip connections, accuracy of a Computer Vision Model can be enhanced. </p>

								<h4 class="major">4. Digit Recognizer</h4>
								<p>After learning basics of Convolutional Neural Networks, I started working on the famous <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer" target="_blank">handwritten digits dataset by MNSIT</a> in <b>May 2020</b>.<br>
								I used two very primitive <a href="https://github.com/007mathur/Digit-Recognizer-in-Python" target="_blank">DL model</a> to obtain accuracies of <b>97.879% from Fully Connected Neural Network Model</b> and <b>99.21% from Convolutoinal Neural Network Model</b>.</p>

								<h4 class="major">5. Titanic</h4>
								<p>I started practicing Machine Learning with the cliche of ML Datasets, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview" target="_blank">Titanic Dataset</a>. I used <b>Logistic Regression</b>, <b>Support Vector Machine(SVM)</b>, and <b>Neural Networks</b> to solve this dataset.<br>
								Out of various features in the dataset, I decided to work on were Passenger class, Sex, Age, and Family count (which I extracted from no. of sibling spouse and parents children).<br>
								The accuracies obtained were <b>81.00% from Logistic Regression</b>, <b>78.77% from SVM</b>, and <b>74.44% from Neural Networks</b>. This <a href="https://github.com/007mathur/Titanic_DataSet" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> to my work.</p>
